# Fostidich

Hi! I'm Francesco Ostidich.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and I am currently pursuing my Master's.

I enjoy learning new programming skills, that's why I regularly challenge myself with different projects.
You can find more about me on my [personal website](https://fostidich.it).
